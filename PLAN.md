- [x] build a level editor

- [x] let the user to stop the playing loop

- [x] add a volume level control

- [x] save user progress in localStorage
      (in such a way that i can easily hack locally to be able to test a specific level
       without having to play them all)

- [ ] make the 2-measure loop playing more musical by playing the first step at the end

- [ ] add a score system:
      - add 15 points for every well-placed step
      - remove 5 points for every misplaced step
      - add 100 points for every completed level

      (not sure if it's a good idea, tbh... need to think more)

- [ ] add "About / help?" button

- [ ] improve the level representation: add time signature information, allow groups

- [ ] design better levels for a smoother and engaging learning curve:
      make it be like a conversation/dialogue with the user
