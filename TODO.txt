[X] change current level order, move metal (hardest) to the end
[X] move play/listen button to the bottom
[X] don't go to next level automatically, this is impeding user feedback
    give feedback and add a button for going to next level

[ ] replace demo by a guided intro

[ ] design levels for a smoother learning curve
    (very easy, easy, easy, medium, medium, hard)
    idea: use the same tempo for the first levels, and when changing it,
    use a pattern similar to the previous one -- semi-isolated contrast is better contrast
